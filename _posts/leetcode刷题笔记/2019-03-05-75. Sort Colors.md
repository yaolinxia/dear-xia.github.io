Given an array with *n* objects colored red, white or blue, sort them **in-place** so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and blue.

Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.

**Note:** You are not suppose to use the library's sort function for this problem.

给定一个具有红色，白色或蓝色的n个对象的数组，对它们进行就地排序，使相同颜色的对象相邻，颜色顺序为红色，白色和蓝色。

这里，我们将使用整数0,1和2分别表示红色，白色和蓝色。

注意：您不应该使用库的排序功能来解决此问题。

**Example:**

```
Input: [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
```

**Follow up:**

- A rather straight forward solution is a two-pass algorithm using counting sort.
  First, iterate the array counting number of 0's, 1's, and 2's, then overwrite array with total number of 0's, then 1's and followed by 2's.
- Could you come up with a one-pass algorithm using only constant space?
