Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".

A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

**Example:** 

Input: 19
Output: true
Explanation: 
1^2 + 9^2 = 82
8^2 + 2^2 = 68
6^2 + 8^2 = 100
1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 = 1

**思路：**
采用递归思想
需要找出数字中的每一位

出现问题：
~~~
class Solution(object):
    def isHappy(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: bool
        """
        s = 0
        for c in str(n):
            s += int(c)**2
        print(s)
        if s == 1:
            return True
        else:
            self.isHappy(s)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    n = Solution().isHappy(19)
    print(n)
